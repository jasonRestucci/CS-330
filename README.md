Computational Graphics and Visualization

<ins>**How do I approach designing software?**</ins> <br><be>
I start with making sure I understand the requirements, both functional and non-functional. It's important to understand the goal(s) or problem the software is trying to solve completely. After that, I start thinking about the design method and general architecture of the software. Once I understand that I can start creating design documents and breaking down development into smaller, more digestible pieces and begin.

I think this project has helped me develop better organizational practices for my code. It's good to leave comments explaining your code but using white space and/or a series of commented-out characters to physically separate parts of your code can go a long way for others, or even yourself, to understand your code quickly and effectively. Originally I began doing this to separate the different objects in the scene we working on in openGL, that way I could find them easier and edit them quickly. I have realized that I should be doing this in all programs I write. I will carry this practice on to my future work.  

<ins>** How do I approach developing programs?**</ins> <br><be>
As I said before, I like to break down development into smaller components, testing regularly through out. Testing is something I have improved on during this course. I found myself utilizing print statements a lot more to ensure values are where they should be or to make sure the correct value is being accessed. I believe my approach has evolved throughout the milestones to be more thorough. It's better to do it right once and not have to go back and sort through all the problems later.

<ins>** How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**</ins> <br><be>
Computer Science, but more specifically computational graphics and visualization is a big component in the video game design industry. Working on a game I am truly passionate about has always been something I would love to do for the rest of my life, having this knowledge and skillset pushes me one step further to achieving my educational and professional goals.
